The patch is updated regularly to keep up with the latest changes and additions in DMO.
 
To install the Patch Fr Pour Digimon Master Online, you need to download it from the official website (https://patchfrdmo.wordpress.com/) and follow the instructions there.

You will also need to run the game in compatibility mode for Windows 7 or 8.
